**Dream:** What are you doing?

**Death:** I`m taking my shoes off. You should take yours too, it’s good to touch the Earth with your <mark>bare feet</mark>. It’s <mark>grounding!</mark> Come on, I don’t want to <mark>miss</mark> the next one.

**Death:** Hi Sam.

**Sammuel:** Hi, I’m sorry. Do I know you? Oh no.. no, no! I need to talk to my wife for, like…one second!

**Death:** Sam…

**Sammuel:** You don’t understand, all our flight information is on my phone. I just need to give her the code.

**Death:** I’m so sorry, Sam.

**Sammuel:** But we are in our honeymoon.

**Death:** Your time is up. Come on, hon.

**Sammuel’s wife:** Sam? Sam?

**Dream:** How do you do it?

**Death:** Do what?

**Dream:** Be there for all of them.

**Death:** I have a job to do. And I do it. When the first living <mark>thing</mark> existed, I was there. When the last living <mark>thing</mark> dies, I’ll put the chairs of the table, turn out the lights and lock the universe <mark>behind</mark> me when I leave.
And I`m not there for all of them, there are exceptions: Mad Hettie, and then there is your <mark>ongoing</mark> project.
How is he <mark>faring</mark> up after all this time?

**Dream:** Who? Hob Gadling?

**Death:** Uhum..

**Dream:** I don’t know. I was forced to <mark>miss</mark> our last appointment.

**Death:** Well, I’m sure he would love to see you. They are never too <mark>keen</mark> to see me, though.

**Dream:** Does it not <mark>bother</mark> you?

**Death:** I actually used to think I <mark>had the hardest</mark> job in all of our family.

**Dream:** Oh, did you?

**Death:** They <mark>fear</mark> the Sunless Lands, yet they enter your <mark>realm every</mark> night without <mark>fear</mark>.

**Dream:** And yet, I’m <mark>far</mark> more terrible than you.

**Death:** It was fine in the beginning. <mark>Dying</mark> and living were new things and people did them with the enthusiasm they always <mark>bring</mark> to new things. And then after a bit, it just got harder.

**Dream:** But you continued…

**Death:** I <mark>thought</mark> about <mark>giving up</mark>, walking out. This was a long time ago, long before this world. It really started to get to me, I got kind of hard and brittle inside.
I <mark>mean</mark>, people <mark>feel as pleased</mark> to have been born as if they did it themselves.
But they get upset and hurt and <mark>shaken</mark> when they die.
But eventually, I learned that all they really need is a kind word and a friendly face.
Like they had in the beginning.
