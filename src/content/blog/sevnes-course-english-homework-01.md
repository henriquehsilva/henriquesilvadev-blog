**Dream:** What are you doing?

**Death:** I`m taking my shoes off. You should take yours too, it’s good to touch the Earth with your bare feet. It’s grounding! Come on, I don’t want to miss the next one.

**Death:** Hi Sam.

**Sammuel:** Hi, I’m sorry. Do I know you? Oh no.. no, no! I need to talk to my wife for, like…one second!

**Death:** Sam…

**Sammuel:** You don’t understand, all our flight information is on my phone. I just need to give her the code.

**Death:** I’m so sorry, Sam.

**Sammuel:** But we are in our honeymoon.

**Death:** Your time is up. Come on, hon.

**Sammuel’s wife:** Sam? Sam?

**Dream:** How do you do it?

**Death:** Do what?

**Dream:** Be there for all of them.

**Death:** I have a job to do. And I do it. When the first living thing existed, I was there. When the last living thing dies, I’ll put the chairs of the table, turn out the lights and lock the universe behind me when I leave.
And I`m not there for all of them, there are exceptions: Mad Hettie, and then there is your ongoing project.
How is he faring up after all this time?

**Dream:** Who? Hob Gadling?

**Death:** Uhum..

**Dream:** I don’t know. I was forced to miss our last appointment.

**Death:** Well, I’m sure he would love to see you. They are never too keen to see me, though.

**Dream:** Does it not bother you?

**Death:** I actually used to think I had the hardest job in all of our family.

**Dream:** Oh, did you?

**Death:** They fear the Sunless Lands, yet they enter your realm every night without fear.

**Dream:** And yet, I’m far more terrible than you.

**Death:** It was fine in the beginning. Dying and living were new things and people did them with the enthusiasm they always bring to new things. And then after a bit, it just got harder.

**Dream:** But you continued…

**Death:** I thought about giving up, walking out. This was a long time ago, long before this world. It really started to get to me, I got kind of hard and brittle inside.
I mean, people feel as pleased to have been born as if they did it themselves.
But they get upset and hurt and shaken when they die.
But eventually, I learned that all they really need is a kind word and a friendly face.
Like they had in the beginning.
