**Dream:** Desire, I <mark>stand</mark> in my gallery and <mark>hold</mark> your <mark>sigil</mark>. Talk to me. 

**Desire:** Why, <mark>sweet</mark> Dream. This is a surprise..<mark>almost</mark> an event, I <mark>might</mark> say.

**Dream:** Good, I’m <mark>coming</mark> through.

**Desire:** You are? You know you are always welcome in my <mark>chambers</mark>. Lovely to see you, is there anything… you desire?

**Dream:** I desire nothing from you save some answers

**Desire:** Hmm, is this a test?

**Dream:** Unity Kincaid should have been the vortex of this era but someone <mark>took</mark>advantage of my <mark>imprisonment</mark> and <mark>fathered</mark> a child with her, <mark>knowing</mark> full well that it would become the vortex, and I would be forced to kill it. 

**Desire:** Was I really that obvious?

**Dream:** No. You <mark>covered</mark> your tracks remarkably well.

**Desire:** Well, that is <mark>high</mark> <mark>praise</mark> coming from you. 

**Dream:**  What did you <mark>truly</mark> <mark>intended</mark>? That I <mark>spill</mark> family blood? With all that would <mark>entail</mark>?

**Desire:** This time it <mark>almost</mark> worked.
